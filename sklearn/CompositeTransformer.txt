A Composite transformer refers to a transformer that is built from multiple other transformers or estimators combining their functionalities to apply a series of transformations or processings steps in a specific way.
Types -> Column Transformer , Pipeline , Feature Union
Column Transformer -> The Column Transformer is a feature transformer from scikit learn that allows different columns or columns subsets of the input datasets to be transformed seperately and the features generated by each transformer to be concatenated into a singlr feature space. This is particularly useful for datasets that contain various types of data requiring different preprocessing steps , such as numerical data that needs scaling and categorical data that needs to be encoded.
